# cmdutils
stupid replica of GNU coreutils but batch/cmd

# installation
put init.cmd somewhere
launch regedit then go to the following directory:
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Command Processor`
then make a string value and make sure it has path to init.cmd

# recommendations
get [CLink](http://mridgers.github.io/clink/) to make it even more cursed

# ... why??
I DON'T KNOW WHY
